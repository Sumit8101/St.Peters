        <h1>About St Peter Academy</h1> <br />
        <span>
          St Peters Academy is an educational institution run by Manav Hitkari
          Sansthan under CBSE norms. <br />
          <br />
          The need of a competent school in the vicinity of Govindpur was being
          felt for a long time. Keeping this need in mind our manager, Mr. Abdul
          Rafiq thought of giving birth to a non- profitable educational
          institute to serve the society and to avoid the inconvenience of going
          to far flung institutes of repute. <br />
          <br />
          Ultimately, foundation stone of St Peters Academy was laid on 8th
          March 1997. Since then continuous efforts are being made for the
          betterment of the school and upliftment of the society.
